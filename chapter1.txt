chapter 1
Nick Carraway introduces himself as a nonjudgmental observer of other people who has recently returned 
to his home in a wealthy Midwestern family from the East Coast after a devastating disappointment. 
This disappointment is the story he is about to tell, which happened two years before.

After graduating from Yale, and fighting in WWI, Nick decides to become a bond trader and moves near 
NYC.

Nick rents a house in West Egg, a Long Island suburb that is less fashionable than East Egg, 
which lies across the Long Island Sound. His tiny, cheap bungalow is next to Gatsbyâ€™s enormous, 
tacky mansion.

Nick goes to have dinner with his cousin Daisy and her extremely rich husband Tom Buchanan, 
whom he knows slightly from Yale. Their house is overwhelmingly decorated. Tom is gruff, aggressive, 
and physically intimidating. Daisy and her friend Jordan Baker are wearing white dresses that look 
like balloons in the breeze. Daisy laughs a lot and speaks in a low, extremely appealing voice. 
Their conversation is scattered and shallow, and everyone talks over each other.
